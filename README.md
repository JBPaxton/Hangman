# <Hangman>

## How To Play

Hangman is a classic word game in which a word is presented as a row of dashes, a dash representing each letter. 

The player must guess the word, letter by letter. If they get a letter correct, all the occurrences of that letter in the word are placed instead of the respective dashes. However, if a wrong guess is made, an extra component is added to a drawing of a person being hanged.

As soon as the final addition is made to the drawing, i.e. after 10 wrong guesses, then the player guessing loses. The Letters are removed after the player clicks a letter, so that the player cannot choose the same letter twice.

## Installation

1: Extract the hangman.rar archive.
2: Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted 'hangman' folder.
3: Type 'npm install' to re-install the node modules.
4: Type 'npm start' to start the package.
